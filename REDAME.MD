# Product Review Analysis

This project analyzes product reviews data using Python and Pandas. The goal is to extract insights such as the top-rated products, most reviewed products, average ratings by category, and a comparison of verified versus non-verified purchase ratings. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculation of average ratings by product and category
- Identification of top 10 highest-rated and most-reviewed products
- Comparison of verified vs non-verified purchase ratings
- Visualization of key insights with bar charts

## Dataset

The dataset (`reviews.csv`) contains product reviews with columns such as:

- `product_name`
- `reviews_rating`
- `reviews_text`
- `categories`
- `reviews_date`
- `verified_purchase`

## Technologies Used
